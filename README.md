# Tower-of-Blocks-Game
The goal of the game is to accurately place moving blocks on top of each other to build a tower with 
as many levels as possible. The blocks must be placed precisely by correctly timing the ‘dropping’ of 
each block. If the block is not centered, the edges that are not aligned with the block below it will 
fall, and the new block becomes a smaller base with which to place the next one. This increases the 
difficulty with each subsequent placement until a maximum height is reached.
